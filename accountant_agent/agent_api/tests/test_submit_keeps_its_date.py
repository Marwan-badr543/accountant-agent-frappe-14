"""Submitting a document must not change the date it is posted on.

WHAT HAPPENED

    A client asked the agent to post a purchase invoice raised five days
    earlier. Their system refused it: *"Due Date cannot be before Posting /
    Supplier Invoice Date"*. It refused every dated document the same way, and
    never refused a Journal Entry — so from the outside the agent "could only
    submit journal entries".

WHY

    `submit()` is `save()` with a docstatus, so it re-runs `validate()`. This
    ERP's `validate_posting_time()` resets `posting_date` and `posting_time` to
    NOW whenever `set_posting_time` is clear. A draft raised on the 25th and
    submitted on the 30th therefore acquires a posting date of the 30th, while
    every date derived from the original one stays where it was — and the
    document refuses itself. A Journal Entry has no `set_posting_time` field,
    which is the whole of why it was the one thing that worked.

WHY PINNING IT IS THE FIX AND NOT A WORKAROUND

    A posting date is an accounting fact. Moving one into a different period on
    the way through a submit is a real error, not a formatting one — and the
    client approved a card showing the date the document already had, so
    writing a different one posts something nobody agreed to.

No site is needed: `frappe.get_doc` and `frappe.logger` are stubbed, and the
stub document reproduces the re-dating behaviour described above.

RUN THEM FROM THE BENCH ROOT, not from the app directory:
